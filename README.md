# oofchat

oofchat is a random project started [ronthecookie](https://ronthecookie.me/) and [jellz](https://jellz.me/).  
We were just bored, and we decided to make it. It is not intended to be a real chat application, as it is quite useless. We just wanted to experiment with socket.io!  

> oofchat supports **Markdown** formatting.

## Features
- simplistic material design.
- built-in typing indicator.
- @mentions support with desktop notifications & highlighting.
- 100% uptime due to heroku's awesomeness.
- supports Markdown formatting.
- per-browser nicknaming system.
- instantaneous messaging.

Enjoy! Made with <3 by Ron & Jellz.
